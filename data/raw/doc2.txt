Title: Chunking Explained

Chunking is the process of splitting a long text into smaller pieces that are easier for models to handle. 

Key points:
- Chunks should have overlap to prevent losing context between pieces.
- Chunk size is often measured in tokens, but character-based chunks work for small tests.
- Proper chunking improves the relevance of retrieved information in RAG pipelines.
