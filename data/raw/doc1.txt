Title: Introduction to RAG Chatbots

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique where an AI model retrieves relevant pieces of information from documents or databases before generating an answer. 

The process usually involves:
1. Splitting documents into chunks.
2. Converting chunks into vector embeddings.
3. Storing embeddings in a searchable database.
4. Using a retriever to find relevant chunks for a query.
5. Passing the retrieved context to a language model to generate an answer.

RAG is especially useful for answering questions over large collections of documents where the model alone may not have seen all the information.
